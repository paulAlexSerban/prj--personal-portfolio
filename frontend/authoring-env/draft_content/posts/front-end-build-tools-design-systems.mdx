Design systems are collections of design elements, such as color palettes, typography, and UI components, that are used to create a consistent look and feel across a website or application. Design systems are an essential part of modern front-end development and can greatly improve the efficiency and consistency of the design process.

There are several front-end build tools that are specifically designed to help create and maintain design systems. Some of the most popular design system build tools include:

- **Style Guide Generator**s: Style guide generators, such as KSS or Hologram, are tools that help you create a living style guide for your design system. These tools extract information about your design elements from your CSS and HTML code, and generate a style guide that can be used by developers and designers to ensure consistent implementation of the design system.
- **Design Tokens**: Design tokens are variables that are used to store design information, such as colors, typography, and spacing. Design tokens can be managed and maintained using front-end build tools, such as Styled Components or Theme UI, which makes it easier to make changes to the design system and ensure consistency across all components.
- **Component Libraries**: Component libraries, such as Material UI or Ant Design, are pre-built collections of UI components that can be used to build websites and applications. Component libraries can be customized to fit the specific needs of your design system and can be used to ensure consistent implementation of the design elements across all components.

In conclusion, front-end build tools and design systems go hand-in-hand in modern front-end development. By using build tools specifically designed for design systems, front-end developers can create and maintain a consistent and efficient design process, resulting in a better user experience and improved overall quality of the product.
