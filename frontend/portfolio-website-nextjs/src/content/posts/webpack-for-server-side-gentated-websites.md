title: "Webpack: Server Side Generation"
subheading: "A popular JavaScript module but not only"
excerpt: "Webpack is a popular JavaScript module bundler that is used to build and package web applications. It processes your application's source code, resolves dependencies between modules, and generates a single bundle or multiple chunks of code that can be efficiently loaded by the browser. With Webpack, you can include different types of assets such as images, fonts, and styles in your application, and it takes care of bundling, transforming, and optimizing them."

Static Site Generation (SSG) is a popular technique for generating a website that consists of only static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. With the rise of JAMstack, SSG has become increasingly popular as it provides several benefits over traditional dynamic websites, including better performance, security, and scalability.

Webpack can be used as a build tool to generate the static assets for an SSG website. With Webpack, you can define your build configuration to compile, process, and optimize the various assets required for your website, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## Here are a few tips for using Webpack for SSG:

- **Use plugins to generate the HTML pages**: You can use plugins such as html-webpack-plugin and prerender-spa-plugin to generate the HTML pages for your SSG website. These plugins can automatically generate the HTML files based on your templates and data, and output them to the appropriate destination.
- **Optimize images**: You can use the url-loader and image-webpack-loader to optimize and process images in your SSG website. These loaders can help you to reduce the file size of your images and improve the performance of your website.
- **Use CSS pre-processors**: You can use CSS pre-processors such as SASS or Less with Webpack to write and compile your CSS code. These pre-processors provide additional features and functionality that can make it easier to write and maintain your CSS code.
- **Use source maps**: Webpack can generate source maps for your CSS and JavaScript code, which can help you to debug your code more easily.
- **Minify and uglify your code**: You can use plugins such as UglifyJSWebpackPlugin and OptimizeCSSAssetsWebpackPlugin to minify and uglify your CSS and JavaScript code. This can reduce the file size of your code and improve the performance of your website.
- **Split your code**: Webpack provides code splitting capabilities that can help you to split your code into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can improve the performance of your SSG website by reducing the amount of code that must be loaded initially.
- **Use environment variables**: You can use environment variables in your Webpack configuration to define different configurations for development and production environments. This can make it easier to manage your configuration and deploy your SSG website.
