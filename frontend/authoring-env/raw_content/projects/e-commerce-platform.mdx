title: 'E-Commerce Platform Architecture'
---

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this architecture document is to outline the design and technical aspects of the E-Commerce Platform project, using the RADIO (Requirements, Architecture, Design, Implementation, and Operation) framework. The E-Commerce Platform will provide a comprehensive online shopping experience with user authentication, shopping cart, product listing, search, and payment integration.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

User Authentication: Registration, login, and password recovery for customers and administrators.
Product Management: Add, edit, and delete products with images, descriptions, and pricing.
Shopping Cart: Add, remove, and update items in the cart, and calculate total cost.
Checkout: Securely process payments and generate invoices for customers.
Search: Search products by keyword, category, or price range.
Product Reviews: Allow customers to submit and view product reviews.
Order Management: Track order status, manage refunds, and view order history.
Admin Dashboard: View sales data, manage products, and handle customer inquiries.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

-   Performance: Fast-loading pages and responsive UI.
-   Scalability: Ability to handle increased traffic and product listings.
-   Security: Secure user data and transactions with encryption and secure APIs.
-   Maintainability: Well-structured codebase and modular components for easier updates.
-   Usability: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for customers and administrators.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

The E-Commerce Platform will be built using a microservices architecture, with the frontend and backend services separated to improve scalability and maintainability. The frontend will be developed using React, Redux, and Material-UI, while the backend will consist of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Stripe API. AWS S3 will be used for static file storage.

### 3.2 Frontend

React: UI framework for building reusable components.
Redux: State management library to manage global application state.
Material-UI: A UI framework for creating responsive and consistent user interfaces.
Axios: HTTP client for making API calls to the backend services.

### 3.3 Backend

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting.
Express: Web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing product and user data.
Stripe API: Payment processing platform for handling secure transactions.
AWS S3: Storage service for storing product images and other static assets.

## 4. Design

### 4.2 Data Model

[Include a diagram or description of the database schema]
User: `id, name, email, passwordHash, role, createdAt, updatedAt`
Product: `id, name, description, price, imageUrl, category, createdAt, updatedAt`
Cart: `id, userId, items[{productId, quantity}], createdAt, updatedAt`
Order: `id, userId, items[{productId, quantity, price}], total, status, createdAt, updatedAt`
Review: `id, userId, productId, rating, comment, createdAt, updatedAt`

## Implementation

### 5.1 Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Package Manager: npm or yarn
Code Linter: ESLint
Code Formatter: Prettier
Test Framework: Jest, React Testing Library
Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions

### 5.2 Project Structure

Frontend
Backend

## Operation

### 6.1 Deployment

Frontend: Deploy the frontend application using AWS S3 and CloudFront for optimal performance and global content delivery.
Backend: Deploy the backend services using AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2 instances with a load balancer for improved scalability.
Database: Use MongoDB Atlas or AWS DocumentDB as the managed database service for easier maintenance and backups.

### 6.2 Monitoring

Performance Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog to track application performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource usage.
Error Tracking: Use Sentry or Rollbar to track and manage errors in real-time, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Logging: Set up logging with AWS CloudWatch or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for better observability and troubleshooting.

### 6.3 Maintenance & Updates

Regularly review and update dependencies to maintain compatibility and security.

Follow Agile development methodologies and use tools like Jira or Trello for project management and collaboration.

Perform code reviews and implement testing to ensure high-quality code and maintainability.

## Conclusion

This architecture document outlines the design and technical aspects of the E-Commerce Platform using the RADIO framework. By following the guidelines and recommendations provided, the development team will be able to build a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly e-commerce platform that meets the project requirements and delivers a seamless shopping experience for customers.
