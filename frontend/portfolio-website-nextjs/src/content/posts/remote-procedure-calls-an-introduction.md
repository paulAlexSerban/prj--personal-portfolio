Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are a powerful tool in modern software development. They allow developers to write distributed applications that can communicate across a network, making it possible to build large, complex systems that can handle high traffic loads. In this post, we'll explore what RPCs are, how they work, and why they're useful.

## What is a Remote Procedure Call?

A Remote Procedure Call is a protocol that allows a computer program to request a service from another program located on a different machine. In simple terms, an RPC allows a program to call a function that is running on a remote computer, as if it were a local function. The client program sends a message to the server program, specifying the function to be executed and any parameters that need to be passed. The server program executes the function and sends back a response to the client.

## Why use Remote Procedure Calls?

RPCs are useful in many situations where you need to call a function that is located on a different machine. Here are a few common use cases:

- **Client-Server Applications** - In client-server applications, the client program communicates with the server program over a network. RPCs allow the client to call functions that are running on the server, making it possible to perform complex operations and retrieve data from a remote database.
- **Microservices** - In a microservices architecture, an application is broken down into smaller, more manageable components. Each microservice can expose an API that can be called using RPCs. This makes it possible to build highly scalable, distributed systems that can handle large amounts of traffic.
- **Cross-Platform Communication** - RPCs can be used to communicate between different platforms and programming languages. For example, a Java program can call a function that is written in Python, and vice versa.

## How do Remote Procedure Calls work?

The basic process of making an RPC involves the following steps:

- The client sends a message to the server, specifying the function to be executed and any parameters that need to be passed.
- The server receives the message and executes the specified function, using the provided parameters.
- The server sends back a response to the client, containing the results of the function call.

There are several different protocols that can be used for implementing RPCs, including JSON-RPC, XML-RPC, and gRPC. Each protocol has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of protocol will depend on the specific requirements of the application.

## Conclusion

Remote Procedure Calls are a powerful tool in modern software development. They allow developers to build distributed applications that can communicate across a network, making it possible to build large, complex systems that can handle high traffic loads. If you're building a client-server application, a microservices architecture, or need to communicate between different platforms and programming languages, RPCs are definitely worth considering.
