## Description:
A sales dashboard is a perfect project for a front-end software engineer to showcase their skills in using data grids, charts, a scheduler, a date picker, and a rich content editor. The dashboard will display various key performance indicators (KPIs) to help sales managers monitor their team's performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Features:

- Data Grid: Display a list of sales representatives, along with their monthly sales, targets, and other relevant information. Allow sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- Charts: Visualize sales data using various types of charts, such as bar, line, and pie charts, to show trends, comparisons, and distributions.
- Scheduler: Allow users to schedule sales meetings, calls, or other events, and send notifications to team members.-
- Date Picker: Enable users to select a specific date range for displaying data in the dashboard.
- Rich Content Editor: Provide a platform for creating and editing sales reports or notes with formatting options, images, and tables.
