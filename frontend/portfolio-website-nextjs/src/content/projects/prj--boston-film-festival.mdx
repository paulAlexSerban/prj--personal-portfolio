The target audience for the website is broad and diverse. It includes people of all ages, cultures, backgrounds, and interests who enjoy watching movies and attending outdoor events. The target audience may include families, couples, groups of friends, and individuals who are looking for entertainment options in their local area.

The target audience may have different reasons for attending the outdoor film festivals.

We believe that film has the power to inspire, entertain, and educate, and we're committed to sharing that experience with as many people as possible. So join us under the stars, and let's make some movie magic together!

## Architecture

The architecture of the website will follow a JAMStack approach. It will consist of a client-side user interface that communicates with a server-side API to fetch data and render pages. The website will be built using HTML for markup and templating, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Handlebars will be used as the templating language to generate HTML.

The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages, which will serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The server-side API will be built using JavaScript and Node.js, which will be responsible for fetching data from the database and serving it to the client. The API will be deployed to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

The client-side and server-side will communicate using RESTful API endpoints. The API will be responsible for handling CRUD operations for the events, reservations, and film list prototypes. The API will also be responsible for sending emails to users who register for events.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure for the website will be hosted on the cloud. The website will be deployed on GitHub Pages, which will serve the static assets for the client-side. The server-side API will be deployed to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. AWS Lambda provides a serverless architecture that will help to scale the API based on demand. API Gateway will be used to manage the API endpoints and handle the authentication and authorization for the API.

The data for the website will be stored in a cloud-based database. MongoDB will be used as the NoSQL database to store the events, reservations, and film list prototypes. The data will be accessed using Mongoose, which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

The website will also use third-party services for email notifications, social media links, and Boston news and Boston Public Gardens links.

- **Layout**: CSS, Sass/Scss, Bootstrap
- **User Experience**: JavaScript

## System Design

The website will be designed to be fully responsive to ensure that it can be accessed from any device. The website will use a mobile-first approach to ensure that the website is optimized for mobile devices.

The user interface of the website will be designed using CSS, Sass/Scss, and Bootstrap. The website will use a modern design with a clean and minimalistic look. The navigation will be simple and easy to use, and it will include links to social media, Boston news, and Boston Public Gardens.

The website will have a news section that will display the latest news and updates from Watch It Outside Events Co. The film list prototype will display the films that will be shown at the outdoor film festivals. The registration form prototype will allow users to register for the events and receive email notifications.

The website will be optimized for SEO, and it will include meta tags, descriptions, and keywords. The website will also be optimized for performance, and it will use techniques like lazy loading, caching, and minification to ensure that it loads fast.
