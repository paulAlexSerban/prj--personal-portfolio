These logs appear to be from Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). They contain information about each HTTP request that CloudFront receives. I'll break down what each component of these logs mean:

- `date` & `time`: The date and time at which the logged event occurred. 
- `x-edge-location`: The location code of the CloudFront edge server that responded to the request.
- `sc-bytes`: The total number of bytes that CloudFront served to the viewer in response to the request, including headers.
- `c-ip`: The IP address of the viewer that made the request.
- `cs-method`: The HTTP method of the request.
- `cs(Host)`: The domain name of the CloudFront distribution.
- `cs-uri-stem`: The portion of the URI that identifies the path and object, like "/index.html".
- `sc-status`: The HTTP status code that CloudFront returned to the viewer.
- `cs(Referer)`: The value of the referer header in the viewerâ€™s request.
- `cs(User-Agent)`: The value of the User-Agent header in the viewer's request.
- `cs-uri-query`: The query string portion of the URI from the viewer's request.
- `cs(Cookie)`: The value of the Cookie header in the viewer's request.
- `x-edge-result-type`: The result type for the request from CloudFront's perspective. "Miss" indicates the object was not in CloudFront's cache and had to be requested from the origin.
- `x-edge-request-id`: A unique identifier for the request.
- `x-host-header`: The value of the host header in the viewer's request.
- `cs-protocol`: The protocol that the viewer used to connect to CloudFront. 
- `cs-bytes`: The total number of bytes that the viewer served to CloudFront in the request.
- `time-taken`: The total time, in seconds, that CloudFront took to respond to the request from the time it received the request.
- `x-forwarded-for`: If the viewer used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of the c-ip field is the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. In that case, x-forwarded-for is the IP address of the viewer that originated the request.
- `ssl-protocol`: The SSL protocol that the client and CloudFront negotiated for the HTTPS connection.
- `ssl-cipher`: The SSL cipher that the client and CloudFront negotiated for the HTTPS connection.
- `x-edge-response-result-type`: This is similar to `x-edge-result-type`, but from the perspective of the origin server.
- `cs-protocol-version`: The version of the protocol with which the viewer made the request to CloudFront.
- `fle-status`: The encryption status of the field-level encryption on the request.
- `fle-encrypted-fields`: The number of encrypted fields in the request if field-level encryption is used.
- `c-port`: The port on the client's machine where the request originated.
- `time-to-first-byte`: The time, in seconds, from when CloudFront received the request to when it started to return the response to the viewer.
- `x-edge-detailed-result-type`: Provides additional details about the result of the HTTP request.
- `sc-content-type`: The value of the Content-Type header in the response.
- `sc-content-len`: The value of the Content-Length header in the response.
- `sc-range-start` and `sc-range-end`: If the request was a Range GET request, these fields indicate the range of the object that CloudFront returned.

In the logs you provided, it

 looks like a client with IP `92.81.72.38` is making GET requests to the CloudFront distribution at `dnkuhi95tgxgs.cloudfront.net`. The requests are for various resources, including the base URL "/", JavaScript files, and an icon file "favicon.svg". In all cases, the objects were not cached (as indicated by "Miss") and were therefore fetched from the origin server. The responses all seem to be successful (HTTP status code 200), and they were served over HTTPS with the TLSv1.3 protocol.
