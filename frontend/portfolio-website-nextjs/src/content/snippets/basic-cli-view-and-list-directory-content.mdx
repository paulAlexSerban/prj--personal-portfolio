## Linking files

Linking files is a great option available in Linux - if you need to maintain two or more copied of the same file on the system, instead of having separate physical copies , you can use on physical copy and multiple virtual copies. This is done by creating a link to the original file. There are two types of links:

- `ln -s main-file symbolic-link__main-file` - will create a symbolic lint to `main-file` (the symbolic link doe not contain info about the original file).
- `ln main-file hard-link__main-file` - will create a `hard-link` that contains information about the original file

NOTE: you can only create hard-links between files on the same physical medium - to create alink under separate physical mediums you must use a symbolic link

## List Wildcard Files

Wildcards are placeholders used to allow users to search for OR use multiple files with similar names

- the asterisk , `*`, represents any character or string of characters - the `a*.txt` could refer to `ab.txt` as well as `aardvark.txt`
- the question mark, `?`, represents a single character - the `a?.txt` could refer to `ab.txt` and `al.txt`, but NOT `aardvark.txt`
