## `nano`

- `nano file1.txt\` - command that opens file.txt in the nano text editing tool;
- `nano -B [filename]` - backup previous version of a file
- `nano -B â€“backupdir=[directory-path]` - backup files into a specific directory
- `nano -E [filename]` - convert tabs into spaces

## `vimtutor`

Vim offers an excellent opportunity called `vimtutor` to practice and get familiar with the editor. It may seem very difficult and complicated at first, but it will only feel that way for a short time. The efficiency we gain from Vim once we get used to it is enormous.
