## `cat`

- display all data inside the file - `cat config.cfg` - concatenates and prints the contents of files
- `cat` - "concatenate" - command used to create, view and concatenate files - it is usually used to read data from a file and see the content as output; - `cat -n config-cfg` - using the `-n` parameter you will get all tine lines numbered - `cat -b config.cfg` - using the `-b` parameter you will number only the lines with text - `cat > myFile.txt` - the command to create a file named "myFile";
  specified time (`touch -t 201510290630 file_2.txt`)
- `cat -A config.cfg` - will show you the end of the line and the tabs


## `more` (pagers)

- to read files, we do not necessarily have to use an editor for that. There are two tools called `more` and `less`,
- these are fundamental `pagers` that allow us to scroll through the file in an interactive view.
- `more fileName` - display's a text file but it stops for each page
  - will show you the contents of the file with the only possibility to see more by pressing enter (return) - use `q` to quit

## `less` (pagers)

- `less fileName` - provides the possibility to scroll, search and more through a file
  - is a file reader - you can use the arrow to read the contents of the file
    - `less config.cfg` - will output the entire file and you can look though it with hte arrows and search for text - to quit use `q`
- `less -N config.cfg` - will output the entire file and you can look though it with hte arrows and search for text - to quit use `q` - the `-N` parameter will show you the line numbers
- `less -S config.cfg` - will output the entire file and you can look though it with hte arrows and search for text - to quit use `q` - the `-S` parameter will show you the line numbers and will not wrap the lines
- `less -S -N config.cfg` - will output the entire file and you can look though it with hte arrows and search for text - to quit use `q` - the `-S` parameter will show you the line numbers and will not wrap the lines - the `-N` parameter will show you the line numbers

## `sort`

- depending on which results and files are dealt with, they are rarely sorted. Often it is necessary to sort the desired results alphabetically or numerically to get a better overview
- `cat /etc/passwd | sort`
  - `cat /etc/passwd` - will output the content of the file
  - `|` - pipe - will take the output of the first command and pass it to the second command
  - `sort` - will sort the output of the first command
- `echo "hello textfile" > file1.txt\` - command that overwrites everything with "hello textfile" into "file.txt";
- `echo "hello textfile" >> file1.txt\` - command that appends "hello textfile" to the content fo the file;
- `sort -r file1.txt` - will sort the file in reverse order
- `sort -n file1.txt` - will sort the file numerically
- `sort -u file1.txt` - will sort the file and remove duplicates
