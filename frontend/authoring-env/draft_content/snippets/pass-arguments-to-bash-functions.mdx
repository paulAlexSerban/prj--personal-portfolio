You can pass arguments to a Bash function just like you would with any other Bash command. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function called "greeting"
greeting() {
    echo "Hello, $1! Nice to meet you."
}

# Call the function with an argument
greeting "John"
```

In this example, the function greeting takes a single argument, which is the name of the person being greeted. When the function is called with greeting "John", the string "John" is passed as the first argument to the function, which is then used in the echo command to print a personalized greeting.

You can also pass multiple arguments to a function by separating them with spaces. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function called "add_numbers"
add_numbers() {
    SUM=$(($1 + $2))
    echo "The sum of $1 and $2 is $SUM"
}

# Call the function with two arguments
add_numbers 3 5
```

In this example, the function add_numbers takes two arguments, which are the two numbers being added. When the function is called with add_numbers 3 5, the numbers 3 and 5 are passed as the first and second arguments, respectively, which are then added together and printed.
