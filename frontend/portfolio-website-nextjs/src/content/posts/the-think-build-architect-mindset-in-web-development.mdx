The Think-Build-Architect mindset is a popular approach in web development that promotes efficient and organized development practices. This approach emphasizes the importance of careful planning, building with consistency, and creating a logical architecture for code. In this blog post, we will explore the Think-Build-Architect mindset and how it can be used in web development.

## Think

Before writing any code, it is crucial to plan the layout of the webpage or web app using a component-driven design approach. This involves breaking down the UI into modular building blocks that are reusable across the project and between different projects. The components are independent, allowing them to be used anywhere on the page. This approach is similar to the "Atomic Design" philosophy and strategy of Brad Frost. The components are called "Organisms" in this approach.

Using this approach, developers can create a consistent and scalable design system that is easy to maintain and update. By thinking ahead and planning the layout of the web application, developers can avoid potential issues and create a more efficient development process.

## Build

After planning the layout of the web application, the next step is to build the layout in HTML and CSS with a consistent structure for naming classes. BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention used in web development that helps maintain low specificity and is easy to maintain and reuse.

BEM defines three types of entities: Blocks, Elements, and Modifiers. Blocks are standalone components that are meaningful on their own. Elements are parts of a block that have no standalone meaning. Modifiers are different versions of a block or an element. By naming classes in this way, developers can easily identify and modify specific parts of the code, making it more efficient to maintain and update.

## Architect

A logical architecture for the CSS and JS is created with files and folders. The "7-in-1 Pattern" is a popular folder structure used in web development that consists of seven different folders for partial SCSS files and one main file to import all other files into a compiled CSS stylesheet. This approach promotes maintainability and makes it easier to find and modify specific parts of the code.

By creating a logical architecture for the code, developers can make it easier to navigate, maintain and update the codebase. This approach also helps to keep the codebase organized, which can reduce the risk of errors and improve the overall quality of the code.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Think-Build-Architect mindset is a powerful approach that can help developers create more efficient and organized web applications. By planning the layout of the web application, building with consistency, and creating a logical architecture for code, developers can reduce the risk of errors, improve the quality of the code, and create a more efficient development process. By using this mindset, developers can create scalable and maintainable web applications that are easier to update and extend.
