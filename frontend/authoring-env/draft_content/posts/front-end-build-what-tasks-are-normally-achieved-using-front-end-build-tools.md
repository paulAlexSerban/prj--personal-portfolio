Front-end build tools are used to automate a wide range of tasks in the front-end development process. Some of the most common tasks achieved using front-end build tools include:

- **Bundling and Minification:** Build tools can be used to combine multiple files into a single file, which reduces the number of requests the browser needs to make to load the application. This can also help to reduce the size of the files, which can improve the performance of the application.
- **Transpiling:** Build tools can be used to convert code written in modern JavaScript syntax into a format that is compatible with older browsers. This allows developers to use the latest language features even if they are not yet supported by all browsers.
- **Asset Optimization:** Build tools can be used to optimize assets such as images and fonts, which can help to reduce the size of the files and improve the performance of the application.
- **Testing:** Build tools can be used to run automated tests on the code to ensure that it is working as expected. This can help to catch bugs and improve the quality of the code.
- **Linting:** Build tools can be used to check the code for syntax errors and ensure that it follows best practices. This can help to improve the quality of the code and make it easier to maintain.
- **Compiling:** Build tools can be used to compile files written in pre-processors such as SCSS into CSS. This allows developers to use advanced features in these pre-processors, which can simplify the development process.
- **Hot Reloading:** Build tools can be used to provide a development server with hot reloading, which allows developers to see changes to the code in real-time without having to manually refresh the browser.

These are just some of the tasks that are commonly achieved using front-end build tools. The specific tasks that are needed will depend on the requirements of the project, but build tools can provide significant time savings and help to ensure that code is of high quality.
