## Project Brief

### Summary
Welcome to the Natours project documentation! Natours is a fictional business that offers green outdoor tours in the Carpathian mountains. This project is a landing page for the business built using modern technologies and best practices in web development. The page is fully responsive, accessible, and optimized for search engines.

### Goal Details
The goal of the Natours project is to create a landing page that showcases the beauty of the Carpathian mountains and promotes the green outdoor tours offered by the fictional business. The page should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide all necessary information to potential customers. The project aims to provide a high-quality user experience and follows a "Think-Build-Architect" mindset.

### Target Audience
The target audience for Natours is people who enjoy outdoor activities and are interested in exploring the Carpathian mountains. This includes both local and international tourists who are looking for unique and memorable experiences.

### Promise
Natours promises to offer high-quality green outdoor tours that allow customers to connect with nature and experience the beauty of the Carpathian mountains. The tours are led by experienced guides who are knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna and are committed to preserving the natural environment.

## Architecture
The front-end of the Natours project uses the following technologies and best practices:

- **Scss preprocessor**: Scss is used to write more efficient and maintainable CSS code.
- **Float Grid Layout**: Float grid layout is implemented for cross-browser compatibility.
- **Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript**: The JavaScript code is organized using Object Oriented Programming principles, making it easier to read, maintain, and extend.
- **Component-based development**: The front-end is built using a component-based approach, which promotes reusability and makes it easier to manage complex UIs.
- **'7-in-1 Pattern' folder structure**: The folder structure follows the '7-in-1 Pattern' to organize partial Scss files and promote maintainability.
- **BEM for CSS class naming convention and architecture**: BEM (Block Element Modifier) is used to name and structure CSS classes in a way that is easy to read and maintain.
- **DRY coding principles**: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) coding principles are followed to promote code reusability and reduce redundancy.

## Infrastructure
The Natours project uses the following infrastructure:

- **Version control system**: Git is used to manage the project's source code and version control.
- **Hosting**: The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, a free web hosting service provided by GitHub.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and deployment. GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that automates the testing and deployment process, making it faster and more reliable.

## Tech Stack
The Natours project uses the following technologies:

- **Markup and Templating**: HTML, Handlebars
- **Styles and Layout**: CSS, Sass/Scss
- **User Experience**: JavaScript
- **CI/CD**: Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Rendering**: JAMStack and Server Side Generation with Webpack

## System Design
The Natours project follows a JAMStack architecture, which stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. This architecture is used to build fast, secure, and scalable websites and web applications.

The Natours project also uses Server Side Generation (SSG) with Webpack to generate static HTML pages at build time. This approach provides many benefits, such as faster page loading times, improved security, and reduced server load.

## Post-MVP Improvements
### Functional Improvements:
- Integration with a booking system to allow customers to book tours directly from the website.
- Addition of a photo gallery to showcase the natural beauty of the Carpathian mountains.
- Integration with social media platforms to allow customers to share their experiences and promote the Natours brand.
### Non-Functional Improvements:
- Optimization of images and other media to improve page loading times.
- Implementation of lazy loading and other performance optimizations to improve page speed.
- Implementation of accessibility best practices to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.

## Conclusion
The Natours project is a well-designed and well-architected landing page that showcases the beauty of the Carpathian mountains and promotes the green outdoor tours offered by the fictional business. The project uses modern technologies and best practices in web development to provide a high-quality user experience. With the addition of post-MVP improvements, the Natours project can become an even more successful and effective marketing tool for the fictional business.
