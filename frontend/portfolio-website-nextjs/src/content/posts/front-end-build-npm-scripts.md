Building a front-end application can be a daunting task, especially when you have to deal with a myriad of dependencies, libraries, and build tools. One of the most popular build tools for front-end development is NPM, which provides a reliable and efficient way to manage your project's dependencies, as well as automate build tasks.

In this post, we will explore the benefits of using an NPM Scripts-based architecture for building front-end applications.

## What is an NPM Scripts-based architecture?

An NPM Scripts-based architecture is a methodology of building front-end applications that utilizes NPM scripts to automate build tasks. It involves breaking down the application build process into a series of small, reusable scripts that are executed using the command line.

NPM Scripts-based architecture can be used to handle tasks such as:

- Building the application for production
- Starting a local development instance
- Transpiling and bundling code
- Running tests
- Linting code
- Minify or Uglify your code
- Deploying the application
- Use in CI/CD pipelines

By using an NPM Scripts-based architecture, you can automate these tasks, making it easier to manage the build process and reduce the likelihood of human error.

## Benefits of using an NPM Scripts-based architecture

### 1. Simple and lightweight

One of the main advantages of using an NPM Scripts-based architecture is its simplicity. There is no need to learn complex build tools, as NPM Scripts provides a lightweight and easy-to-use interface. This makes it easier for developers to get started with building front-end applications.

### 2. Flexibility

NPM Scripts-based architecture is highly flexible, allowing you to customize the build process to suit your needs. You can use existing scripts, modify them, or create your own scripts. This flexibility ensures that the build process is tailored to your project's specific requirements.

### 3. Consistency

By using an NPM Scripts-based architecture, you can ensure that the build process is consistent across different environments. This means that the same scripts can be used to build the application on different machines, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.

### 4. Better Collaboration

NPM Scripts-based architecture also makes it easier for developers to collaborate on front-end projects. With a standardized build process, developers can work on different parts of the application without worrying about inconsistencies in the build process.

### 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment

Finally, NPM Scripts-based architecture can be easily integrated with continuous integration and deployment tools, such as Travis CI and CircleCI. This ensures that the application is built, tested, and deployed automatically, reducing the time and effort required to manage the build process.

## Best Practices

When using an NPM Scripts-based architecture to build front-end applications, there are several best practices that you should follow to ensure that your build process is efficient, reliable, and consistent. Here are some of the key best practices:

- **Keep your scripts small and focused**: Each script should be focused on a specific task, such as transpiling code, running tests, or deploying the application. Keeping scripts small and focused makes it easier to maintain and modify the build process.
- **Use descriptive names for your scripts**: Use clear and descriptive names for your scripts, so that it's easy to understand what each script does. For example, use "build" instead of "b" or "deploy-production" instead of "dp-prod".
- **Use flags for conditional behavior**: Use flags to control the behavior of your scripts based on different conditions, such as whether the build is for development or production. For example, you can use the "--prod" flag to trigger the production build.
- **Use package.json to manage dependencies**: Use the package.json file to manage dependencies and scripts. This makes it easier to keep track of dependencies and ensures that the same dependencies are used across different environments.
- **Document your scripts**: Document your scripts, including what they do, what their dependencies are, and how to run them. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the build process and contribute to the project.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your build process is efficient, reliable, and consistent, making it easier to maintain and scale your front-end application.

## Pitfalls

While NPM Scripts-based architecture offers several benefits, there are also some pitfalls that you should be aware of. Here are some of the key pitfalls to watch out for:

- **Limited flexibility**: While NPM Scripts-based architecture is highly flexible, there are some limitations to what you can achieve using scripts. For more complex build processes, you may need to use additional build tools, which can add complexity to the build process.
- **Lack of built-in features**: Unlike dedicated build tools like Webpack or Gulp, NPM Scripts doesn't have built-in features for tasks such as code splitting or hot reloading. While you can use NPM Scripts to trigger these tools, it can add complexity to the build process.
- **Steep learning curve**: While NPM Scripts-based architecture is simple to use, it can take some time to get used to the command line interface and understand how scripts work. This can make it challenging for new developers to get started with the build process.
- **Poor error handling**: When running scripts, errors can sometimes be difficult to diagnose and fix, particularly if the error is caused by a problem with a dependency. This can lead to frustration and slow down the build process.
- **Lack of community support**: While NPM Scripts-based architecture is popular, it may be more difficult to find support and resources compared to more established build tools like Webpack or Gulp.

By being aware of these pitfalls, you can mitigate the risks and make an informed decision about whether NPM Scripts-based architecture is the right approach for your front-end build process.

## Knowledge Prerequisites

To work with NPM Scripts-based architecture for front-end build, there are some knowledge prerequisites that you should have:

- **Familiarity with the command line interface**: You should be comfortable using the command line interface, as NPM Scripts are executed through the command line.
- **Knowledge of NPM**: You should have a good understanding of NPM, which is used to manage dependencies and execute scripts. This includes knowing how to install packages, update packages, and manage dependencies.
- **Understanding of package.json**: You should have a good understanding of the package.json file, which is used to manage dependencies and scripts. This includes knowing how to add dependencies, create scripts, and manage versioning.
- **Familiarity with Git**: You should have a good understanding of Git, which is used for version control. This includes knowing how to create branches, commit changes, and merge changes.
- **Understanding of build processes**: You should have a good understanding of the build process, including how to transpile code, bundle assets, and optimize performance.

By having these knowledge prerequisites, you can be confident in your ability to work with NPM Scripts-based architecture for front-end build and make the most of this approach.

## Combining Bash scripts with NPM Scripts

Combining Bash scripts with NPM Scripts is a powerful approach that allows you to execute custom scripts, automate repetitive tasks, and streamline your front-end build process. Here are the steps to combine Bash scripts with NPM Scripts:

1. **Create your Bash script**: Start by creating a Bash script that performs the task you want to automate. For example, you could create a script that runs your unit tests, deploys your application, or optimizes your images.
2. **Add your script to package.json**: Open your package.json file and add a new script that executes your Bash script. For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "bash scripts/test.sh",
  "deploy": "bash scripts/deploy.sh",
  "optimize": "bash scripts/optimize.sh"
}
```

In this example, we have added three new scripts to package.json that execute Bash scripts located in the "scripts" directory. The "test" script executes the "test.sh" Bash script, the "deploy" script executes the "deploy.sh" Bash script, and the "optimize" script executes the "optimize.sh" Bash script.

3. **Make your Bash script executable**: Make sure that your Bash script is executable by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/test.sh
```

This sets the executable permission on the "test.sh" Bash script, allowing it to be executed by NPM.

4. **Run your script**: To execute your script, simply run the corresponding NPM script. For example, to run the "test" script, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will execute the "test" NPM script, which in turn executes the "test.sh" Bash script.

By combining Bash scripts with NPM Scripts, you can automate repetitive tasks, streamline your front-end build process, and make your development workflow more efficient.

## Glossary of some common build phases or tasks

- "clean" - phase removes all files generated by the previous build, and may involve pre-cleaning (processes needed prior to the actual project cleaning) and post-cleaning (processes needed to finalize the project cleaning) processes.
- "initialize" phase sets up the build state, such as setting properties or creating directories.
- "develop" phase involves writing code, testing, and debugging.
- "validate" validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available, and ensures that the project is correct and has all necessary dependencies.
- "start" This script starts the development server. For example, in a Node project, it can run the server using nodemon.
- "build" phase generates production code and may use tools like webpack to minify and bundle the code.
