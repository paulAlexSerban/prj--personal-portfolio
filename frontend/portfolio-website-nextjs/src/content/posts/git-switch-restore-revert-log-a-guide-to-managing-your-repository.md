Git provides several commands to help you manage your repository and track changes over time. In this blog post, we'll explore four of these commands - switch, restore, revert, and log - and how they can help you work more effectively with Git.

## Switch

The switch command allows you to change between different branches or commits in your repository. This is useful when you want to work on a different branch or review changes that were made in the past.

To switch to a different branch, use the following command:

```bash
git switch [branch name]
```

To switch to a specific commit, use the following command:

```bash
git switch [commit hash]
```

## Restore

The restore command allows you to undo changes made to your repository. This is useful when you accidentally make a change you didn't intend to or want to undo a change that caused a problem.

To restore a file to its previous state, use the following command:

```bash
git restore [file name]
```

To restore all files in your repository to their previous state, use the following command:

```bash
git restore .
```

## Revert

The revert command allows you to undo a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository. This is useful when you want to undo a change but still preserve the commit history of your repository.

To revert a commit, use the following command:

```bash
git revert [commit hash]
```

This will create a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit.

## Log

The log command allows you to view the commit history of your repository. This is useful when you want to see who made changes, when they were made, and what changes were made.

To view the commit history, use the following command:

```bash
git log --graph
```

This will display a list of all the commits in your repository, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

## Conclusion

In summary, the switch, restore, revert, and log commands can be incredibly useful when working with Git. By using these commands effectively, you can switch between different branches and commits, undo changes, revert commits, and view the commit history of your repository. This can help you work more efficiently and effectively, and make it easier to collaborate with others on your project.
