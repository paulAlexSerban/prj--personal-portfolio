Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track and manage changes to their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become one of the most popular version control systems used in software development today. In this blog post, we will go over some of the basic concepts of Git that every developer should know.

## Repository

A repository is a collection of files and directories that Git tracks. It is also known as a repo. A repository can be local to your computer or hosted on a remote server like GitHub. A repository contains all the versions of your code and keeps a history of changes made to the code over time.

## Commit

A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the codebase. When you commit changes, you are saving a new version of the code to the repository. Each commit has a unique identifier known as a hash. Commits are important because they allow developers to track changes to the codebase over time and collaborate with other developers.

## Branch

A branch is a version of the codebase that is separate from the main codebase. It is like a parallel universe where you can make changes to the code without affecting the main codebase. Branches are useful for developing new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting with new ideas. Once you are satisfied with the changes you made on a branch, you can merge the branch back into the main codebase.

## Merge

Merging is the process of combining two branches together. When you merge a branch, you are taking the changes made on that branch and applying them to the main codebase. Git uses a three-way merge to ensure that the changes are merged correctly. If there are conflicts between the changes made on the two branches, Git will prompt you to resolve them before the merge can be completed.

## Pull Request

A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch to another. It is usually used when working on a project with multiple developers. Pull requests allow other developers to review your changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This is useful for ensuring that the codebase is of high quality and that there are no bugs or errors.

In conclusion, Git is an essential tool for software development. By understanding the basic concepts of Git, you can easily track changes to your codebase, collaborate with other developers, and ensure that your code is of high quality. If you are new to Git, we recommend learning more about these concepts and practicing using Git on a small project before using it on a larger project.
