In this tutorial, we will be walking through the process of creating a simple CLI tool using the Bash scripting language. The tool will provide a help option, a version information option, and a custom output file option. It's a great start to automating tasks and creating your own tools.

The Script
Here is the Bash script we will be discussing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A basic boilerplate for a CLI tool using Bash

function show_help() {
cat << EOF
Usage: ${0##*/} [-h] [-v] [-o OUTFILE] [FILE]...
This is a CLI tool template.
    -h          display this help and exit
    -v          display version information and exit
    -o OUTFILE  define the output file. Default is 'output.txt'.
FILE is the name of the file to process.
EOF
}

# Initialize our own variables:
output_file="output.txt"
version="1.0.0"

while getopts "hvo:" opt; do
    case "$opt" in
    h)
        show_help
        exit 0
        ;;
    v)  echo "Version: $version"
        exit 0
        ;;
    o)  output_file=$OPTARG
        ;;
    esac
done

shift $((OPTIND-1))

# The rest of the script can go here. For now, let's just echo the output file and remaining arguments:
echo "output_file='$output_file', Remaining args: $@"
```

### Script Breakdown

**Shebang (#!/bin/bash)**

The first line is called a shebang. It tells the system this script should be executed using Bash.

**Help Function**

Next, we define a function `show_help` that displays the usage of the tool when called. This is typically invoked by the `-h` or `--help` flags.

**Variable Initialization**

We then initialize some variables that will be used in the script. `output_file` is the name of the output file, which defaults to `output.txt`. `version` is the current version of the script.

**Option Processing**

The `while` loop uses the `getopts` function to process command-line options. In this case, `-h` displays the help message, `-v` shows the version information, and `-o` sets the output file.

**Shift Arguments**

The `shift` command removes the processed options from the argument list, leaving the remaining arguments, which in our case, could be files to process.

**Script Body**

Lastly, we have the main body of the script. In this case, it simply echoes the name of the output file and any remaining arguments.

### Using the Tool

To use this tool, save it as a `.sh` file and give it execute permissions with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`. Then, you can run it with `./scriptname.sh`. You can pass in `-h` to see the help message, `-v` to see the version information, and `-o outputfile` to set the name of the output file.

Remember to replace "scriptname.sh" with the name of your script.
